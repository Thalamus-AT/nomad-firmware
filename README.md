## Output Options
A variety of output options can be defined using the `-o` options along with one of the following keywords:
- `none` - No output.
- `fancy` - After each polling the values are written onto the same line rather than moving to a new line.
- `gui` - Shows all output through the GUI, nothing is written to the command line.
